Summary:

o	Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used.
o	Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities.
o	Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running. These tools can scan the entirety of the code in a single pass. 
o	Inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning, as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.
o	The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system— long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access. The idea is to imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order to steal an organization’s most sensitive data.
o	Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited
o	Sensitive data that was accessed
o	The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected          
o	Develop and maintain technical documentation around the discovery and mitigation of threats and vulnerabilities.
o	Deep understanding of web application security threats, vulnerabilities, exploits, and prevention (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, platform hardening, etc.).
o	Experience with Agile/SCRUM software development models.
o	Knowledge of web related technologies (web applications, web services, and service-oriented architectures) and of network/web related protocols.
